                    As a part of this course I learnt many interesting advanced algorithms in C++ and some new
                    coding techniques, and ways to speed up the code using advance algorithms. Bit manipulation,
                    modulo arithmatic, advanced graphs, fenwick tree, DP and Bit masking,
                    Number theory, game theory, segment trees, computational geometry, fast fourier transform (FFT)
                    and HLT are some of the many topics I learnt as a part of this course.

                    As a part of this training program, I Studied the concepts of full stack web development, which
                    includes Front end web development as well as back end web development. I also studied React JS,
                    Redux
                    in depth in this training program and found it really fascinating how React uses state as its
                    root to manipulate most of the DOM Structure. After this course, MERN Stack Web Development
                    became my main strength.
